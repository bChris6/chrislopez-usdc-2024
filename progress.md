# 1 Find if term is in text
First I completed my finding if the term is in text function. It did not take too much time and I was especially helped out by the string.includes() function which made implementing this super easy. 
I implented the tests as well and they return PASS in all three cases, when I checked a correct case, an incorrect case, a capitalized wrongly case, and I added a test to see if it could even find phrases with spaces. I also checked these in both Chrome and Mozilla and I got the same answers!
